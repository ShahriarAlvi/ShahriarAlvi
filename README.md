Hello there, it's Shahriar Alvi. I am from Bangladesh, an undergrad student from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. I'm studying Software Engineering here. 
I am a total newbie, just learning c++ and finding my way into coding and problem solving.  
I love anime, I love to watch tv series and casual gaming is another one of my passions. 
My profile is empty like a desert right now, but I hope to fill it with codes and stuff by the end of the year. 
Thank you for staying with me.
